# MDPythonTasks
A repository for storing accomplished tasks from Michael Dawson's "Python Programming for Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition", starting from chapter 3. [captainobvious]As you can guess, all the codes are written in Python programming language.[/captainobvious] When a task is accomplished, its code will be submitted in this repository.

I will not submit the codes that are written in the book as examples for obvious reasons. Because, well, I didn't write them! Michael Dawson did.
